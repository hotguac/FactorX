reFactor Patch Librarian for Eventide's modFactor pedal

done
- sends a sysex message requesting the current patch
- receives and parses (somewhat) the returned patch
- ui menu for jack presents midi input and output ports
- selecting ports from menus disconnects any existing connection for that
port and connects the selected port

to do
- refactor out much of the ui code to eliminate brute force coding
- a whole bunch of stuff, including figuring out the fields that I don't
understand yet
- modify patches
- store and retrieve patches to disk
- send the retrieved patch back to the pedal
